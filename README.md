# Watcher of Friends Online

This script can help you to watch, which of your friends are online.

# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

# Quickstart

For start script you need to run the script in console/terminal.

```bash
$ python vk_friends_online.py
```

# Output example:
```
Number of friends online : 3
1: Denis Kogan
2: Геннадий Василевский
3: Анатолий Багрицкий
```
